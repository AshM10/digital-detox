# digital-detox 👩🏼‍💻

Welcome to the digital-detox project! This project was inspired by the popular "Happy Mind 100 Ways to Switch Off and Digital Detox" card game from Paladone, and aims to bring the game to a wider audience by making it available online.

The digital-detox project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and vite, a lightweight development server.

## Getting Started

To get started, please make sure you have the latest version of Node.js and yarn installed on your machine. Once you have that, you can clone the project and run the following command in the project directory:

``` yarn install ```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project to run.

You can then start the development server by running:

``` yarn dev ```

This will start the server and launch the app in your default browser.

## Using the app 💃🏼

The app includes a digital-detox game where players can pick a card that gives them a prompt to switch off from digital devices and engage in an activity that promotes mindfulness, relaxation and self-care.

## Conclusion 📍

We hope you enjoy playing the digital-detox game and find it beneficial in helping you switch off from technology and find some balance in your life.
